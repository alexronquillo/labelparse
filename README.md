# Label Parse

`Label Parse` is a simple Python program to parse issues and labels from Github Projects.

This program will only work with github projects that are public if you wish to
query a private repo you can use a [Github PAT](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token)
to authenticate.
